        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Is it profitable to bet on home teams, that are underdogs, to win the game outright?</li>
            <li>Is it profitable to bet on home teams, that are underdogs, to win the game outright, if the home team was on a ‘bye’ the week before?</li>

        <h2>Where I Gathered My Data</h2>
        <p>
            I gathered my data from: <a href="https://collegefootballdata.com/exporter/lines?seasonType=regular" target="_blank">College Football Data Exporter</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I queried it by year, which provided me with a .csv file of every gambling line of the regular season from that year.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Cleaning and Integrity</h2>
        <p>
            After combining every year into one database, I had a total of 33,780 rows of data. This felt like a lot of games for an ~11-year time span, so I checked for duplicates in my data. 
            This revealed ~20,000 duplicate lines, as the data source logged betting lines for the same games from different providers (e.g., FanDuel, DraftKings, MGM, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            I resolved this issue by creating a new table called <strong>unique_lines</strong>: 
            <a href="https://github.com/Aeneas-Roberson/Aeneas-Roberson.github.io/raw/main/unique_lines.txt" download>[unique_lines.sql]</a>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Home Underdogs</h2>
        <p>
            I then created a table called <strong>home_underdogs</strong>: 
            <a href="https://github.com/Aeneas-Roberson/Aeneas-Roberson.github.io/raw/main/home_underdogs.txt" download>[home_underdogs.sql]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This table included every game where the formatted spread was "away_team -". This generated 3945 results:

        <h2>Analyzing Spreads</h2>
        <p>
            I analyzed the mean, mode, and median spreads of home underdog winners: 
            <a href="https://github.com/Aeneas-Roberson/Aeneas-Roberson.github.io/raw/main/mean_spread.txt" download>[mean_spread.sql]</a>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mean:</strong> 6.21</li>
            <li><strong>Mode:</strong> 3</li>
            <li><strong>Median:</strong> 5</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This provided insights into profitable trends. I then created a query to find winners, losers, total games, Moneyline values, and profitability for spreads from 0.5–10.5:
            <a href="https://github.com/Aeneas-Roberson/Aeneas-Roberson.github.io/raw/main/cfb_underdogs_query.txt" download>[cfb_underdogs_query.sql]</a>.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Effect of Bye Weeks</h2>
        <p>
            To test if teams coming off a bye week were more profitable, I ran the same test while cross-referencing team schedules: 
            <a href="https://github.com/Aeneas-Roberson/Aeneas-Roberson.github.io/raw/main/cfb_underdogs_bye_query.txt" download>[cfb_underdogs_bye_query.sql]</a>.
        </p>
        <img src="https://github.com/Aeneas-Roberson/Aeneas-Roberson.github.io/raw/main/HomeUnderDogsOffBye.png" alt="Home Underdogs Off Bye Graph">
        <p>
            The results were surprisingly underwhelming compared to the profitability of regular home underdogs.
